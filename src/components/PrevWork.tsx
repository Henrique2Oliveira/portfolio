            At Finan√ßor, a leading company in the agri-food sector, I worked as an Electrical Technician with a focus on industrial automation and control systems. My role combined hands-on electrical work with programming tasks, including configuring and troubleshooting PLCs, writing ladder logic, and supporting SCADA systems for real-time monitoring.
            <br />
            I contributed to improving production efficiency by integrating sensors and control devices, optimizing electrical panels, and collaborating with automation teams to develop smarter, programmable solutions for recurring issues.
            <br />
            This role strengthened my skills in industrial programming and automation within a fast-paced production environment.
